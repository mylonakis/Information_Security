+ **Assignment 1:** Ιmplemented from scratch, using C, three basic but fundamental cryptographic algorithms: One-time pad, 
                    Caesar’s cipher, Vigenère’s cipher

+ **Assignment 2:** A symmetric encryption tool in C, using the OpenSSL toolkit. The tool provides encryption, decryption,
                    CMAC signing and CMAC verification functionality. Utilizing the EVP API found in OpenSSL toolkit to
                    develop the AES cryptographic algorithm in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode with both 128 and 256 bit modes.


+ **Assignment 3:** An asymmetric encryption tool in C, from scratch. Provides RSA key-pair generation, encryption and decryption  

+ **Assignment 4:**  Access Control Logging system using the C programming language. The access control logging system monitors                      and keep track of every file access and modification that occurs in the system.

+ **Assignment 5:** A basic ransomware, which encrypts a number of files and delete the original unencrypted files.

+ **Assignment 6:**

+ **Assignment 7:**
