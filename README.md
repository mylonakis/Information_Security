+ **Assignment 1:** Ιmplemented from scratch, using C, three basic but fundamental cryptographic algorithms: One-time pad, 
                    Caesar’s cipher, Vigenère’s cipher

+ **Assignment 2:** A symmetric encryption tool in C, using the OpenSSL toolkit. The tool provides encryption, decryption,
                    CMAC signing and CMAC verification functionality. Utilizing the EVP API found in OpenSSL toolkit to
                    develop the AES cryptographic algorithm in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode with both 128 and 256 bit modes.
